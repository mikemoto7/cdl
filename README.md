# cdl
cd List Tool

Bash shell script function.  Allows you to save Linux directory paths so that you can cd back to them later.  Similar in idea to push and pop.  But offers many more features and keeps track of the saved directory paths using a file so you're less likely to lose your cd list, and you'll be able to backup your list.
